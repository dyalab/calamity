Follow these instructions to teleoperate the schunk arm via joystick control.
Most of them are taken from the sns tutorial, so if you need more help that would likely be your best resource.

You are assumed to have sns & ach installed, you might need amino as well but I'm not sure

RUN SNS TELEOPD
===============

Set Up Environment
------------------


* Run the sns_tutorial_setup.sh file to set up appropriate environmental variables and ach channels.
* You will need to change the SNS_SCENE_PLUGIN variables depending on your setup
* The sns tutorial has you running the command:

      	cd amino && ./configure --enable-demos --enable-demo-schunk && make
	
* But I think that since you already have the necessary urdf files this may not be necessary?

Run Simulation Tests
--------------------

* These are optional but will help check that you can run the simulation without any added complications
* You can look for errors in /var/log/user.log and /var/log/syslog
* Simulate the arm:
  
	sns start
  	sns-ksim -y state -u ref
  	sns stop

* Simulate the arm in the background

  	sns start
	sns run -d -r bg-ksim -- sns-ksim -y state -u ref
	sns stop

Teleoperate the Arm
-------------------

* Start the joystick/gamepad driver (for 6-axis gamepad)
* Make sure that the little switch on the back is set to 'D' for the correct button/trigger mappings
* TODO: update this command with ntd's parameters to fix things

  	sns run -d -r joy -- sns-joyd-logitech-f310 -a 6

*Dump the joystick channel to see how the axes are set up

      	snsdump joystick joystick

*Start the simulator:

        sns run -d -r bg-ksim -- sns-ksim -y state -u ref

*Start the teleoperation controller. The -Q parameter controls which button enables the subsequent set of axes

       sns-teleopd -j joystick \
             -y state \
             -u ref \
             -Q 4 -m "robot_1_joint,robot_2_joint,robot_3_joint,robot_4_joint" \
             -Q 5 -m "robot_5_joint,robot_6_joint,robot_7_joint"

*That should be it!
