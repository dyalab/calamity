Check out section 4.3 for what each bit sent does.

Check out section 4.4 for what each bit recieved means.

Section 4.7 describes how to send commands to set bits.

IMPORTAINT INFO:
First register for output - 0x03E8
First register for input - 0x07D0

In order to set a bit given a specific register, send that register 2^(bit number). To set multiple bits add up all the 2^(bit number)s that you want to set.

For example, to set bit 1 send the command 0x01.
For bit 2, send 0x02.
For both bit 1 and bit 2, send 0x03.

Page 55 contains a nice table of possible commands and importaint info.
